# Engine

## About

This project is created in learning purposes. It represents(at least intended) to be 
a **general purpose game engine**. 

The desired "things" to be present:
- [ ] 2D and 3D Renderer(Vulkan, OpenGL, DirectX11 and DirectX12)
- [ ] Slang shading language usage
- [ ] Scenes 
- [ ] Animation system
- [ ] Physics 
- [ ] An editor(imgui/C++ or WPF/C#) with "blueprints"
- [ ] Scripting(Mono C# and Lua)
- [ ] AI
- [ ] SIMD usage
- [ ] Networking
- [ ] Sound 


The set of this things is composed of the different stuff i want to try to work with,
obviously that some of the features won't be necessary, but as previously said, the purpose of the 
project is learning.
